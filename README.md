# Important notice
effective immediatly I will stop working and uploading my repos to github. It was quite a nice journey and github did help me but their recent changes lead me away from the platform. I did already back up so if anyone wants to mess with me feel free to delete all repos... tho why would you?

I am moving to gitea here: https://gitea.com/danlp6
